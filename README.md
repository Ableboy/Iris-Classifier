# Identification of an Iris Flower

## Description

This project uses machine learning to classify iris flowers based on features such as petal length and width. It demonstrates basic classification algorithms and provides an educational example for learning machine learning.

## Features

- Load and preprocess the Iris dataset.
- Train machine learning models (e.g., k-means clustering, decision trees) for classification.
- Visualize classification results with plots.

## Library Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ableboy/Iris-Classifier.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd Iris-Classifier

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Use Case

Educational purposes for learning and demonstrating machine learning classification algorithms.
